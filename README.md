# mathematrix
An application for generating problems for mathematics ranging from a 1st grade level to dwelling a little bit into advanced topics like set theory and advanced geometry.

## Scope
- 1st grade math to 10th grade math covered thoroughly
- partially covering topics for undergraduate math programs
- users will be able to see history of previous generated programs

## Modules used
- kivy : gui, all platform compilation
- sympy: math functions
- matplotlib: graphs
- tinydb: generated history
- pyinstaller: compiling into runnable binaries
- pytest: testing functions
- appdirs: directory management
- poetry: modules management

## future
- time trial based quizzes
- lan party kahoot like lobbies
